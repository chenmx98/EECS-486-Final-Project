terminate it gone now court because obamacare no good but then i made decision run well can people great people run well can i could gone other route made everybody very unhappy they ran it premiums down everything down here problem no matter well run no good what wed like do terminate it we individual mandate done i dont know going work if we dont win we run well obamacare better run but no longer obamacare because without individual mandate much different preexisting conditions always stay what i would like do much better health care much better well always protect people pre existing so id like terminate obamacare come up brand new beautiful health care the democrats do because therell tremendous pressure them and we might even house time and i think were going win house okay

legislature i terminated individual mandate that worst part obamacare we call it the individual mandate we pay fortune privilege not having pay bad health insurance i terminate it gone now court because obamacare no good but then i made decision run well can people great people run well can i could gone other route made everybody very unhappy they ran it premiums down everything down here problem no matter well run no good what wed like do terminate it we individual mandate done i dont know going work if we dont win we run well obamacare better run but no longer obamacare because without individual mandate much different preexisting conditions always stay what i would like do much better health care much better well always protect people pre existing so id like terminate obamacare come up brand new beautiful health care the democrats do because therell tremendous pressure them and we might even house time and i think were going win house okay youll see i think were gonna win house but come up better health care always protecting people pre existing conditions one thing very important we 180 million people out great private health care far more than were talking about obamacare joe biden going terminate those policies these people love health care people successful middle income people successful they 180 million plans 180 million people families under wants
