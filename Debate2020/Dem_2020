kamala s harris if public health professionals if dr fauci if doctors tell we should take ill first line take it absolutely but if donald trump tells we should take im not taking it harris so let tell first day i got call joe biden actually zoom call asking serve ticket probably one most memorable memorable days life i know i thought about mother came united states age 19 gave birth age 25 kaiser hospital oakland california and thought id sitting right now i know would make proud must looking down this you know joe i were raised very similar way we were raised values about hard work about

great recession responsible recovery act brought america back and now trump pence administration wants take credit ran rode coattails joe biden success economy had beginning term of course now economy complete disaster joe biden one hand did that on other hand donald trump has reigned over recession being compared great depression on one hand joe biden responsible president barack obama affordable care act brought health care over 20 million americans protected people pre existing conditions also did saved those families otherwise were going bankrupt because hospital bills could not afford on other hand donald trump court right now trying get rid – s harris – trying get rid affordable care act means lose protections if preexisting conditions and i just very important susan – harris – just

create 7 million more jobs than donald trumps and part those jobs created joe biden going about clean energy renewable energy because see joe understands west coast country burning including home state california joe sees happening gulf states being battered storms joe has seen talked farmers iowa whose entire crops destroyed because floods and so joe believes again science ill tell something susan i served i first got senate committee responsible environment do know administration took word science off website and then took phrase climate change off website this we seen pattern

creation millions jobs we achieve net zero emissions 2050 carbon neutral 2035 joe has plan this has lot talk trump administration really has go backward instead forward we also reenter climate agreement pride s s s s s harris on issue jobs – harris let talk about that you vice president earlier referred part thinks accomplishment preident trade war china you lost trade war you lost it what ended up happening because so called trade war china america lost 300000 manufacturing jobs farmers experienced bankruptcy because it we manufacturing recession because it and we look administration

resulted loss american lives american jobs america standing there weird obsession president trump has had getting rid whatever accomplishment achieved president obama vice president biden for example created within white house office basically just responsible monitoring pandemics they got away got rid it s s harris there team disease experts president obama vice president biden dispatched china monitor now predictable might happen they pulled out we now looking 210000 americans lost lives let look job situation we mentioned before trade deal – trade war wanted call – china it resulted loss over 300 manufacturing jobs manufacturing recession american consumer paying thousands dollars more goods because failed war called it and let talk about standing pew reputable research firm has done analysis shows leaders formerly allied countries now decided hold greater esteem respect xi jinping head chinese communist party than do donald trump president united states commander chief united states this we today because failure leadership administration s s harris so know joe – i love talking joe about lot these issues know joe i think said quite well he says know foreign policy might sound complicated really relationships – just think about relationships and so we know personal professional relationships – guys keep word friends got loyal friends people stood got stand them you got know adversaries keep check but we seen donald trump has betrayed friends embraced dictators around world let take example russia so russia – i serve intelligence committee united states senate america intelligence community told russia interfered election president united states 2016 playing 2020 christopher ray director fbi said same donald trump commander chief united states america prefers take word vladimir putin over word american intelligence community look friends nato he has walked away agreements – can look iran nuclear deal now has put position we less safe because building up might end up being significant nuclear arsenal we were deal guys we were iran nuclear deal friends allies around country because donald trump unilateral approach foreign policy coupled isolationism pulled out has made america less safe so susan about relationships and thing has always part strength nation addition great military has we keep word but donald trump doesnt understand because doesnt understand means honest s s s s s harris but i would like equal time harris first mueller family i know about daughter case im so sorry im so sorry what happened awful and should never happened and i know joe feels same way and i know president obama feels same way but mentioned soleimani let start there so after strike soleimani counter strike troops iraq and suffered serious brain injuries know donald trump dismissed as headaches and about pattern donald trump has referred men serving military suckers losers donald trump went arlington cemetery stood above graves fallen heroes said what them because course know only thinks about him let take said about john mccain a great american hero and donald trump says doesnt deserve called hero because prisoner war take – very important when want talk about current commander chief care about dont care about public reporting russia had bounties heads american soldiers know bounty is somebody puts price head pay if killed and donald trump has talked least six times vladmir putin never brought up subject joe biden would never do that joe biden – joe biden would hold russia account threat nation security troops sacrificing lives sake democracy safety s s s s s s s harris im so glad little history lesson let do little more in 1864 – s harris mr vice president im speaking im speaking in 1864 one i think political heroes –

every age every gender – perfect strangers each other – marched shoulder shoulder arm arm fighting finally achieve ideal equal justice under law and i part those peaceful protests and i believe
